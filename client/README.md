This project was initiated with create-react-app.  It features a live streaming database with auth sign-in/sign-up via google firebase/firestore.  The application also features redux implementation to house react state references and HOC to handle async functions pulling in data using a spinner.  The site is currently hosted online through firebase at https://franklingeneralsdb.web.app/.
